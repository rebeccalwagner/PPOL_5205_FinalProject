            <p> In this project, I explore two topic modeling techniques on a corpus of congressional bills. First, I implement a traditional Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, and second, a Correlated Topic Model. I compare and contrast both methods through their results.

            <h2>A Refresher on Latent Dirichlet Allocation</h2>

            <p>
                Topic modeling is a text analysis technique that assigns “topics” to documents by modeling patterns of words across the corpus. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a common implementation of topic modeling that is unsupervised, generative, and probabilistic. In other words, it does not have predefined outcomes, but "generates" the probability of identified patterns occuring. 
            </p>

            <p>
                "Generates", here, is in quotation because the model does not <em>actually</em> create new documents. Rather, it assumes that documents are created according to an algorithm and attempts to reverse engineer this algorithm. The algorithm has 3 steps for generating each document:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose the length of the document:
                    <div class="math">
                        \( N \sim \text{Poisson} \)
                    </div>
                    where \( N \) is the number of words.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    Choose the mix of topics:
                    <div class="math">
                        \( \theta \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\alpha) \)
                    </div>
                    where \( \alpha \) controls how “mixed” or “pure” the document topics are.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    For all \( N \) words:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Choose which topic generates the word:
                            <div class="math">
                                \( Z_n \sim \text{Multinomial}(\theta) \)
                            </div>
                        </li>
                
                        <li>
                            Then choose the specific word from that topic:
                            <div class="math">
                                \( w \mid z, \beta \)
                            </div>
                            where \( \beta \) controls word–topic relationships.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Once this document generation reverse-engineering is complete, the LDA model can assign topic probabilites to each document and word probabilities to each topic, allowing us to analyze the underlying thematic structure of the corpus.

            <h2>Applying LDA to Congressional Legislation</h2>
            <p> I collected a corpus of 1,657 pieces of legislation from both the House of Representatives and Senate that are tagged with “Housing and Community Development”. These contain any bill introduced in either chamber across all stages of the legislative process.
            </p>

            <p> I applied standard preprocessing including a custom set of stop words (such as ammend, subsection, paragraph) and lematization. I also created bigrams within documents such as “Fannie Mae” and “census tract” in an effort to maintain some context.
            </p>

            <p> The LDA model was implemented using the Gensim python library, with both the alpha and beta parameters set to auto. This feature of the gensim library allows the LDA model to learn an asymetric prior from the corpus itself. With some consideration and parameter tuning, I settled on 10 topics across the corpus—this value resulted in a reasonable balance of coherance and perplexity. These 10 topics are described in Table 1 and the following interactive.

    <p> Notably, sevearl of these topics are thematically similar and visually overlapping. For example, topics 1 and 8 both have to do with federal oversight, while topics 2, 9, and 10 all seem to address housing assistnace. However, we have no way of characterizing the relationships between topics outside of the principal component analysis. Correlated Topic Modeling can help bridge this gap.

            <h2>An Introduction to Correlated Topic Modeling</h2>
            <p>
                While LDA generates a mixture of topics, it does not generate correlations between these topics. 
                In many real-world applications, topics are unlikely to be completely independent of each other. 
                This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to generate topic mixtures.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Correlated Topic Modeling (CTM)</strong> is a variation on LDA that addresses this limitation. 
                Instead of a Dirichlet distribution, CTM draws topic proportions from a logistic normal distribution 
                with parameters \( \mu \) and \( \Sigma \). 
                The generation process is otherwise identical to traditional LDA.
            </p>

            <p>
                Notably, the \( \Sigma \) parameter is a covariance matrix and 
                <em>allows for correlations between topics</em>. It also allows us to analyze these correlations.
